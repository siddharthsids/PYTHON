What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","\n","- Python is a high level open source, interpreted, free,functional, object oriented programming language. It is very popural because of it's simple syntax efficiency and beginner friendly interface.\n","\n","- Python is accessable on any device and work on any platform like Window, MacOs and linux. It has large number of libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Django etc.\n","\n","- It is used in AI Development, Web Development, Data science, Automations etc.\n","\n","- Python has a clean and readable syntax, making it easy for beginners and professionals alike.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"PXQ5i2aDRR76"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","- Interpreter is the program in the python that reads, translates and run the codes line by line. It run the codes line by line from the Human readable language to the machine readable and executable code."],"metadata":{"id":"69oJJqSTUp4o"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","- The keywords are reserved words in the python syntax and structure that has a specific functionality and meanings.\n","\n","- It cannot be used as variable or cannot be classified as identifiers."],"metadata":{"id":"U620BuAGUnWr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","\n","- NO, the keywords cannot be used as variable since keywords has a specific functionality in the python language.\n","\n","- Python's sytax will consider that as a keyword because of the function assigned to that keyword and it will not consider that as a variable."],"metadata":{"id":"uv9UycjEXaGy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5. What is mutability in Python?\n","- The ability to change the variable and assigned value called mutability in python, It allow the coder to change the value of the object and allows to modify it as well even after initialization.\n","\n","- list,sets,dictionaries etc are the examples in which you can add , remove and change or modify the object.\n","\n","on the other hand:\n","- There are immutable objects as well that cannot be changed after the initializations or once it is created.\n","- Numbers, Tuples, Strings are the examples of immutable objects."],"metadata":{"id":"VVQyK0jXY6sF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","\n","- List are mutable because it is designed for the data collection. You can add, remove or modify the list as your program runs and works on real time changes in the Data.\n","\n","- Tuples are immutable because it is designed for holding the fixed data. Tuples cannot be changed once it is created, neither it can be modified. Tuple is enforced as immutable by the python language because it can contain the fixied data or dictionary keys.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"raAzbnYzcCfc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7.  What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","- The '==' sign is used when the value of the variables have the same exact value, even if they are in the diffrent memory locations. It gives you True as the result if the vlaues are equal, and gives False as the result if the value is not equal.\n","\n","- The 'is' operator is used when the two variables are pointing the to the same exact object in the memory location, even if they have a different values.

What are logical operators in Python ?\n","- The logical operators are used to apply multiple conditions and give you the result according to the conditions provided by the programmer.\n","It can be used for the decision making and condition applcations. It is usually used in 'if' statements and conditional expressions.\n","- Logical operators are:-\n","\n","  - 'and' if the both operands are same gives you True otherwise it will give False as a result if one of them is not correct.\n","  - 'or' if the one of the two operands is correct gives you True otherwise gives you false if both are False.\n","  - 'not' now it gives you the answer according to the conditions, Gives you True if operands are false and gives False if operands are True."],"metadata":{"id":"G22nmopeYYiM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9. What is type casting in Python?\n","- The commands a coder gives to change the value from one data type to another data type manually using the python's built in functions is called type casting.\n","It is usually used to change the data type to perform a certain operation.\n","\n","Exmaple\n","- int() to convert the data type into integers.\n","- str() to convert the data type into str.\n","- float() to convert the data type into float.\n","- list(), tuple(), set(), dict(): Used for converting between sequence and collection type."],"metadata":{"id":"or9b6mpJbrCg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n","- The Implicit type casting is when the python automatically converts the data type when needed.

What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","- The conditional statements are primarily used when builting a program which takes decisions according to the conditions given by the programmer.\n","- It evalutes all the conditions and gives you the result accordingly by executing all the given conditions one by one.\n","- The conditional statements allows the executions on a certain required condition only.\n","- Giving the conditions and modifying it makes a program more efficient and adapt in the different scenarios.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"YWOtKjqpkyKg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["12.

What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n","- 'for' loop is used to iretrate over a sequence. The number of irterations are predetermined and easily calculable based on the sequence.\n","\n","- 'while' loop is used to perform a block of code repeatedly until you get a certain condition appers true. Iterations are not fixed and depends on the condtions where it becames true.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Ez1ZZOnEoUnS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["14.
